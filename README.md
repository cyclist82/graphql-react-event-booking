# graphql-react-event-booking
GraphQH React Event Booking Service

Project following and coding along the course [Build a Full App with GraphQL, Node.js, MongoDB and React.js](https://www.academind.com/learn/node-js/graphql-with-node-react-full-app/) by [Maximilian Schwarzmueller](https://www.academind.com/).

I'm following the project, as I'm very interested in GraphQL and finding out the differences between React and Angular, which I know better already.
